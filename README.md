This project involved working collaboratively to explore, clean, and analyse a real-world dataset using SQL. The aim was to transform raw data into a usable format and extract insights that could inform business decisions.

I focused on writing and refining SQL queries to:
- Clean and validate data, ensuring consistency and accuracy
- Join multiple tables to create unified datasets
- Aggregate and filter data to identify trends and key metrics
- Present findings in a clear and structured format

Through this project, I strengthened my technical ability in SQL, data transformation, and query optimisation, while further developing my collaboration, analytical thinking, and problem-solving skills.
